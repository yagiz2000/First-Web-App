# First-Web-App
Don't judgeme because that's my first oop and first javascript (also used bootstrap4 but not effectivelly) project. I know lots of methods can be shortcuted. Nevertheless, project completed in 2-3 hours.
I choose local storage to keep my data.
I am also open to your advices. There will be some DOM projects like this.
